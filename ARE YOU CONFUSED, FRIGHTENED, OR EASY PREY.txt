If you buy a copyrighted book, you are free to throw it away, or to give it away to someone else. However, the Visual Artists Rights Act is a federal law that provides some additional protections for certain artworks. Its scope is extremely limited. To fall within the Act, the work must be a painting, drawing, print, photograph, or sculpture that has only a single copy or that was released as a limited edition of 200 or fewer copies. Works released as a limited edition must be signed and consecutively numbered. If an artwork is reproduced in a publication, VARA rights still protect the original.

Many copyrighted works are made by employees for their employers, or are specifically commissioned by a certain person. These are classified as works made for hire, which means that the creator of the work does not have copyright ownership. Instead, the employer or the person who commissioned the work holds copyright ownership. VARA does not apply to works made for hire, with respect to either the artist or the person who commissioned the work.)
